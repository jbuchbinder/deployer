DEPLOYER
========

Our "deployer", meant to deploy containerized J2EE applications to Tomcat,
JBoss, Jetty, etc containers.

You're going to have to write some of your own XSL overrides for server.xml
and customize configuration files, variables, manifests, etc, for this to
work in your environment. Guaranteed. It worked well for us, enjoy...

Authors
* Jeff Buchbinder
* Vladimir Vuksan

Dependencies
* PHP with XML support
* rsync

Things which have to be customized for this to work...
* /dist : This should hold a heirarchical tree with your software releases in
  it, in the form /dist/${PRODUCT}/${PRODUCT}-${VERSION}.tar.gz
* config.php : Set your local values
* repository_sync.php : Should be set up to sync from your software repository,
  which in the case of the example also has a /dist directory structure.
* keys/id_rsa : Needs to be populated with a ssh key which can be used to gain
  root access to the application servers.
